This package offers various methods for imputing missing values, either in
cross-sectional, time-series or panel data sets.

Please report bugs or comments on the gretl mailing list or write to
atecon@posteo.de.

Note: The add-on "extra" supplies a function named gap_filler() for imputing
missing values. However, it only supports very basic methods of imputation.

GUI support
===========
You can call the functionality via the menu entry
"Variable -> Impute missing values".

Public functions
================

===========================================
impute(const series y, const string method)
===========================================
Call method for imputing missing values of series "y".

Parameters:
-----------
y       -- series, target on which to impute missing values
method  -- string, method (or strategy) by which to impute missing values.
           Note, in case of a panel dataset, the method is applied to each
           cross-sectional unit separately. The following methods are supported

  "min":    Replace missing values using the minimum of 'y'
  "max":    Replace missing values using the maximum of 'y'
  "mean":   Replace missing values using the mean value of 'y'
  "median": Replace missing values using the median value of 'y'
  "cum":    Replace missing values using the cumulated value of 'y'
  "mode":   Replace missing values using the most frequent value of 'y'
  "first":  Replace missing values using the first valid observation value
            of 'y'
  "last":   Replace missing values using the last valid observation value of
            'y'
  "frontfill": Propagate last valid observation forward to next valid value
               (does not work for panel data)
  "backfill": Use next valid observation to fill gap (does not work for panel
              data)
Returns:
--------
Original series 'y' but with replaced missing values.
HINT: For cross-sectional data the ordering is arbitrary, and you should be
cautious with using strategies such as "first", "last", "frontfill" and
"backfill", respectively.


================================================
impute_by_sts(const series y, bundle opts[null])
================================================
Impute missing values of 'y' by means of a structural time-series model (using
the 'StrucTiSM' package). For details see the manual of the 'StrucTiSM'
package. Works only on time-series dataset.

Parameters:
-----------
y       -- series, target on which to impute missing values
opts    -- bundle, Optional key-value pairs can be passed to determine the
           type of components which are passed to the STSM_setup() function:
             "seasonal" (default 2 = stochastic with dummies)
               Other value(s): 0 = none, 1 = stochastic with trigonometric
                 terms, 3 = deterministic dummies
             "slope" (default: 1 = stochastic)
               Other value(s): 0 = none, 2 = deterministic
             "trend" (default: 1 = stochastic)
               Other value(s): 2 = deterministic
             "irregular" (default: 1(=TRUE) = with irregular component)
               Other value(s): 0(=FALSE) = without irregular component

Returns:
--------
Original series 'y' but with replaced missing values.


========================
backfill(const series y)
========================
Use next valid observation to fill gap. The function does not work for panel
data.
It works as Pandas' fillna() "bfill" method
(https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.fillna.html)

Parameters:
-----------
y       -- series, target series

Returns:
--------
Series with imputed values. If no valid values exists for a unit, NA is
returned.  By definition, if the first observation is missing, this cannot be
imputed by this strategy.


=====================
first(const series y)
=====================
Compute first valid value for cross-sectional and time-series datasets,
respectively. In case of a panel dataset, the first valid value of each panel
unit is obtained instead (equivalent to the pfirst() function of the
"PanelTools" package).

Parameters:
-----------
y       -- series, target series

Returns:
--------
Series with the first valid value of "y" (for each cross-sectional in case of
a panel dataset). If no valid values exists for a unit, NA is returned.


=========================
frontfill(const series y)
=========================
Propagate last valid observation forward to next valid value. The function does
not work for panel data. It works as Pandas' fillna() "ffill" method
(https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.fillna.html)

Parameters:
-----------
y       -- series, target series

Returns:
--------
Series with imputed values. If no valid values exists for a unit, NA is
returned. By definition, if the last observation is missing, this cannot be
imputed by this strategy.


====================
last(const series y)
====================
Compute last valid value for cross-sectional and time-series datasets,
respectively. In case of a panel dataset, the last valid value of each panel
unit is obtained instead (equivalent to the plast() function of the
"PanelTools" package).

Parameters:
-----------
y       -- series, target series

Returns:
--------
Series with the last valid value of "y" (for each cross-sectional in case of a
panel dataset). If no valid values exists for a unit, NA is returned.
